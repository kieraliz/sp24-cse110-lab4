## Part 2: A Little More of a Challenge

**Q1**: After running the for loop, the code will return the value of `prices.length` from the `prices` parameter. It will print
```
3
```

**Q2**: After running the for loop, the code will return the last calculation of `discountedPrice` from the last `prices`. It will print
```
150
```

**Q3**: After running the for loop, the code will return the last calculation of `finalPrice` from the last `prices`. It will print
```
150
```

**Q4**: The code will return an array of all discounted prices, `[50, 100, 150]`

**Q5**: The variable `let i = 0` is only defined in scope for lines 6-10. Line 12 is not within the same block scope as the `i` variable, so the code will return an error. 

**Q6**: The same logic applies in Q5 ^ and the code will return an error. 

**Q7**: The variable `finalPrice` is calculated in the for loop, and it will print:
```
150
```

**Q8**: The variable `discounted` is calculated in the for loop, and it will return the final discounted array: `[50, 100, 150]`

**Q9**: The variable `i` is only defined in scope for the for loop in lines 6-9. Line 11 is not within the same block scope as the `i` variable, so the code will return an error. 

**Q10**: The code will return the value of `prices.length` with no error
```
3
```

**Q11**: `discounted` is initially declared in line 3 `const discounted = []`. The code attempts to change `discounted` in line 8, which is not allowed with `const`, so the code will return an error.

**Q12**: <br>
a. We access the student name with `student.name` <br>
b. We access the student Grad Year with `student["Grad Year"]` <br>
c. We access the student greeting with `student.greeting()` <br>
d. We access the student Favorite Teacher with `student["Favorite Teacher"].name` <br>
e. We access the student courseLoad at index 0 with `student.courseLoad[0]`
