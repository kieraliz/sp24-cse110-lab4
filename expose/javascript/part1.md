## Part 1: A Quick Introduction...

### var declaration

**Q1**: The code will print
```
values added: 20
```

**Q2**: The code will print
```
final result: 20
```

### let declaration

**Q3**: The code will print
```
values added: 20
```

**Q4**: The variable `let result = 0` is only defined in scope for lines 3-11. Line 13 is not within the same block scope as the `result` variable, so the code will return an error. 

### const declaration

**Q5**: `result` is initially declared at `const result = 0`. The code attempts to change `result` in line 7, which is not allowed with `const`, so the code will return an error.

**Q6**: The same logic applies in Q5 ^ Additionally, the variable `const result = 0` is only defined in scope for lines 3-11. Line 13 is not within the same block scope as the `result` variable, so the code will return an error.
